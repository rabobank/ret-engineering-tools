/**
 * Context of the current RET execution
 *
 * This class is used to pass information about the context to plugins. Those in turn can use it to base logic upon.
 * Note that this class needs to be registered for reflection in your plugin. To do that: add the annotation `@RegisterForReflection(targets = [RetContext::class])` to your entry command.
 * @property command the full command, as ran in the terminal. This is used to determine which plugin should be loaded.
 * @property environment the environment from which the RET command is ran. This is a custom environment variable, set by the caller. By default, it is "CLI".
 * @property gitRepository the Git repository, if RET was called from a Git directory.
 * @property gitBranch the current Git branch, if RET was called from a Git repository.
